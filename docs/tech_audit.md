# Full-Stack Website Tech Audit: BalmGrip

## 1. **Project Overview**
E-commerce website to sell my original product, BalmGrip, designed to solve the problem of losing your chapstick by keeping it conveniently attached to your keychain.

## 2. **Frontend**
### Framework: Next.js

### Why Use Next.js?
This is an e-commerce website, so fast page loads are crucial â€” every second a customer waits increases the likelihood of them leaving. In addition, I need to be capable of optimizing the SEO of the website for gaining organic traffic. 

Next.js's hybrid rendering paradigm is ideal as it ensures optimal initial page loads and SEO extensibility by serving fully fleshed out HTML via server-side rendering. It also provides seamless page navigation via client-side routing which makes for a smooth User Experience.

- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**:
  - Ships the entire HTML with with assets such as images and videos already embedded in the markup
- **Improved SEO**:
  - By serving the HTML from the server for specific routes, this makes pages more crawlable by search engines, boosting organic visibility.
- **Built-in Image Optimization**:
  - Automatically serves images in modern formats and sizes, improving load times.
